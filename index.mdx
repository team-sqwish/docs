## Welcome to Sqwish API

Welcome to the Sqwish API documentation. This guide will help you understand how to use our real-time prompt optimization API.

With Sqwish, you can optimize long text prompts into shorter, token-efficient versions, saving computation and costs when working with large language models.

response = sqwish_client.text.optimize(input_prompt)
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="JavaScript">

```javascript
const { Sqwish } = require('sqwishai');
const sqwishClient = new Sqwish(process.env.SQWISH_API_KEY);

const inputPrompt = "Write a haiku about recursion in programming.";

```

## Use Cases

- **Reduce latency** in real-time or low-latency environments
- **Handle longer documents** within a single context window
- **Keep chatbots snappy** even as conversations grow
- **Lower costs** for frequent short prompts
- **Fit more documents** into RAG flows
