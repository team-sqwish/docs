## Use Cases

Explore how the Sqwish API can be used in various scenarios:

- **Reduce latency** in real-time or low-latency environments (e.g. finance, analytics).
- **Handle longer documents** or complex queries within a single context window.
- **Keep chatbots snappy** even as conversations grow.
- **Use optimized multi-shot examples** for chain of thought promptingâ€”fewer tokens, faster thinking, same reasoning.
- **Fit more documents** into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) flows.
- **Lower costs** for frequent short prompts by optimization every time.
